Bouncing Balls 
A mesmerizing p5.js animation featuring 50 colorful balls bouncing around the canvas with realistic physics and constantly changing colors.
Description
This project creates a dynamic particle system where multiple balls move independently across the screen. Each ball has its own velocity and bounces off the canvas edges, creating an engaging visual display. The balls continuously change colors as they move, creating a vibrant and hypnotic effect.
