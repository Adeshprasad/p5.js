Four Bouncy Balls 
A colorful p5.js animation featuring four balls bouncing around the canvas with smooth physics.
Description
Four balls bounce simultaneously around the canvas, each with random colors that change every frame. All balls move at the same speed but start from different positions, creating synchronized yet varied motion patterns.
Features

Four Ball Animation: Multiple balls moving with identical physics
Dynamic Colors: Each ball changes color every frame
Synchronized Movement: All balls share the same speed (4 horizontal, -3 vertical)
Edge Bouncing: Balls reverse direction when hitting canvas boundaries
Smooth Animation: 100 FPS for fluid motion
